&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, James here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our final week in Ely, we drove out to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nps.gov/grba/&#34;&gt;Great Basin National Park&lt;/a&gt; where we got to see Wheeler Peak, the second highest mountain in Nevada.  This is a wonderful, out of the way park that we really should&amp;rsquo;ve spent a few more days exploring. Wheeler Peak is 13,065 ft high, and you can drive to over 10,000 ft in your car - It really hits home just how high you are when you realize that if you were in an airliner, you could go to the bathroom at this height on a normal flight :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;wheeler-peak.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;wheeler-peak&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After visiting the park, including the Peak and doing the Lehman Cave tour, we stopped by an amazing little gourmet restaurant called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stargazernevada.com/&#34;&gt;Kerouac&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; started by a couple from New York who started it in 2017. There&amp;rsquo;s not much else on Highway 50, that&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s known as &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;The Loneliest Road in America&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. You might go for dozens of miles without seeing anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also stopped by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://parks.nv.gov/parks/ward-charcoal-ovens&#34;&gt;Ward Charcoal Ovens&lt;/a&gt; only used for three years during the 1870s silver boom. Ezri loved playing with the echoes in the ovens, and the surrounding country-side was beautiful and made for a great little day hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri-oven.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri-oven&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;echo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;echo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wrapped up Ely by Rebecca and Ezri learning to bake together - She loves to be involved in any activity we&amp;rsquo;re doing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri-stirring.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri-stirring&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri-rebecca-stirring.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri-rebecca-stirring&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;short-stay-in-elko-nv&#34;&gt;Short stay in Elko, NV&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, from Rebecca (since James had to travel to Orlando for work):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ely was a great transition for Elko, since Ezri got used to the sound of trains and was no longer scared of them. All of the RV parks are close to the train tracks, and trains were a normal occurrence for us. Elko was a short stay, only a week. Unfortunately, since we drove on Saturday, and were setting up the RV Sunday, James didn&amp;rsquo;t get much of a chance to see the town before we headed out again the following Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ezri and I went to the Chamber of Commerce, which is run from an old fort and has historic wagons and buildings on the lot. The only thing Ezri was really into there was the rocking chairs on their front porch. Next door to that is the Northeastern Nevada Museum, which has some examples of local rocks and gems, and historic clothing and daily living items. They also have a wing with over 200 taxidermy animals from all over the world, many of which I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen before. &lt;img src=&#34;rocking-chair.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;rocking-chair&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got our first glimpse of real fall, and a neighbor loaned us their rake so we could make a pile to play in. Ezri loved playing in the leaves, and helping remake the pile each time it spread out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;leaves-play.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;leaves-play&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;leaves.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;leaves&#34; /&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;grass.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;grass&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drive to Boise was rather eventful for us. Due to 2 RV parks near Boise having the same name, and a bit of assumption on our part that we were navigating to the same place, a quick stop for gas caused me to take an entirely different route than James, that was an hour longer. By the time we realized the issue, doubling back would cause the same amount of time difference, so I corrected the destination and continued on. We both experienced snow, hail, rain, and extremely high winds on our drive. At one point, my heart rate was high for long enough that FitBit automatically logged an aerobic activity for me, lasting 23 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;onward-to-boise-id&#34;&gt;Onward to Boise, ID&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Rebecca said, our drive to Boise was pretty interesting, so here is a photo of my snowy drive, at least from before it really started sleeting and before the wind blew so hard and I was too white-knuckled holding the RV on the road to take many pictures!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>All Aboard to Ely Nevada!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ely_train.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re getting close to the end of our stay in Ely, and it&amp;rsquo;s been a really great time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a train museum here, with a steam train and a diesel train you can buy tickets for. We rode the steam train, and Ezri had so much fun talking about the train and imitating the choo choo. The ride itself takes 90 minutes, with historical information peppered throughout. We were surprised to learn that in the early 1900s, Ely was the biggest town in Nevada, and had the tallest building (the Nevada Hotel, a whopping 6 stories high). The amount of ore that the trains have hauled during the 1900s was staggering as well, how much was needed for a small amount of copper was very surprising. Ezri has been getting better and better about conquering her fears; it was awesome seeing Ezri go from mildly terrified when we first arrived to absolutely excited and wanting to get closer to the train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also went up to Garnet Hill, and found a few super tiny garnets. We&amp;rsquo;re planning on going up to Great Basin National Park this week, and James is trying to convince me we can find space to store a few fishing poles in the RV so we can go fishing at Cave Lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a bit colder than we anticipated, but true to high desert, the temperature varies greatly from the night to day. We have gotten a good system of using the propane heater at night while it&amp;rsquo;s below 30, and opening the windows during the day to keep from going above 80 inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wifi has been slow at best, which I suppose we should have expected (James said he totally saw this one coming). It&amp;rsquo;s done wonders for our streaming habits, and I felt nostalgic today trying to download a file, and watching the estimated time go from 2 days to 3 days, to 5 days, to a download failure. We ordered a Netgear Nighthawk N1 LTE Modem with external antennas, and a few sim cards from Google Fi to get our own network going, a cost we had hoped to hold off until after the house sells, but a necessity for staying sane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We knew we were going to a remote area, with much fewer amenities, but it really didn&amp;rsquo;t sink in until we saw this shirt in the gift shop. The nearest Walmart will be at our next stop, Elko, which we will be driving to on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cole’s Law Brakers - Living on the Road</title>
      <link>https://www.colefamily.page/posts/2019-09-21/first-post.html</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;rv.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;rv&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much thought, research, and planning, we’re almost ready to hit the road! Our first target is Issaquah, Washington (near the Seattle area) where the client James is working with is located. We’re taking our time getting there, going up through Nevada, to a corner of Idaho, over into Oregon, and then into Washington. We don’t have exact dates for all of the locations yet, but we have locked in our reservation in Ely, Nevada for October 1st through 12th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebecca has quit her job and will be trying to keep Ezri out of trouble full time with a little freelance work during naps, while James will continue to work for RedHat and fly back and forth to his client in Issaquah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see our planned stops, potential places to live, and current location on the map at any time. We’ll be updating at least every time we change locations. If you know of cool places we should check out along the way, definitely let us know!&lt;/p&gt;
