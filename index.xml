&lt;h3 id=&#34;southeast-michigan-nov-14-may-1&#34;&gt;Southeast Michigan (Nov 14 - May 1)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;rv_winter.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;rv_winter&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey friends! It&amp;rsquo;s been a wee bit longer than I&amp;rsquo;d thought since we last had an update. We had a great time in Milan, Michigan (close to Emily in Saline and near Ann Arbor). Ezri had an exciting joint birthday with her cousin Vera, complete with balloons. She now thinks anytime she has a balloon, we have to get one for Vera too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri_vera.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri_vera&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;birthday.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;birthday&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all got together for Christmas as well. While we didn&amp;rsquo;t get to have the usual celebration with all of my siblings and parents, we were very glad to be near my sister Emily and her crew. Ezri got entirely too many presents of course, and we had to rearrange her room to fit it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;chrismas_tree.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;chrismas_tree&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri_lights.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri_lights&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri_piano.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri_piano&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our friends, David and Cindy Parent, and their kids live just about a half hour to the South of Milan in Sylvania Ohio, so after much discussion of safety, we were able to visit with them over the Winter and Spring as well. We used to see them all the time when they lived in Las Vegas, so it was great to get together again. They know the owners of a trampoline park, so they also found out the best, least busy time to go bounce around. Ezri had a blast, James got to play a few great rounds of dodgeball with the older kids, and I discovered just how bad I am at slack-lining. Ezri is anxious to go again, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri_trampoline2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri_trampoline2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri_trampoline.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri_trampoline&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;david.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;david&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went with Emily for a drive up to Frankenmouth, Michigan once the weather got a little less cold. The town was founded by German immigrants, so there is some really interesting architecture and it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a tourist trap. We didn&amp;rsquo;t make it through too much of the town, as we spent entirely too much time and money in a board game shop we found, but it was definitely a fun trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri_franken.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri_franken&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went with David and Cindy to the Toledo Zoo. Ezri is always excited to see the fish, and we were really looking forward to the petting zoo area. She was a little scared of the goats and alpacas, but we did get her to touch them a few times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;zoo_aquarium.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;zoo_aquarium&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;zoo_girls.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;zoo_girls&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the weather warmed up a bit more we drove out to Monroe, Michigan on the edge of Lake Erie to play on the beach. We found a tree that had recently been cut down before it fell down, and Ezri had fun hiding in the stump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;lake.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;lake&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;stump.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;stump&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easter weekend was colder than we&amp;rsquo;d hoped, but we were lucky to find an egg hunt event we could participate in. They did it a little different, most of the eggs were empty and only a few had tickets for prizes. We didn&amp;rsquo;t get any tickets, but we did get a bag of candy for collecting at least one egg, and then sponsors handed out other goodies on the way back to the car. The opportunity for Ezri to interact with adults other than us was great, she likes talking to other adults but her volume is so quiet they almost never hear her, especially through the mask.&lt;img src=&#34;ezri_egg.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri_egg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;bunny.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bunny&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;easter.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;easter&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Ezri and talking, over the last few months she has decided she is a cat. We&amp;rsquo;re sometimes struggling to get her to use any words other than &amp;lsquo;meow&amp;rsquo;, which makes for hilarious (to me) episodes of her crying meows at James while he tries to figure out what&amp;rsquo;s keeping her from going to sleep at bedtime. Her cat name changes frequently, often just made up names, but she&amp;rsquo;s got a favorite she likes to use: &amp;lsquo;Pompom&amp;rsquo;. We have considered adopting a cat, but with  the size of the RV and Daisy&amp;rsquo;s history of chasing cats, we decided instead to get a hamster, that Ezri has named Mango. Mango loves running around the RV in her hamster ball, and Ezri spends entirely too much time at night watching Mango instead of letting herself go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri_hat.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri_hat&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;hamster.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;hamster&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the winter we only got serious snow twice, but we made sure to enjoy it when we got it. Spending the winter here was a bit of test to see if we can handle it after so many years in the desert, and I think this was a more mild winter than normal, but overall we are feeling a-ok with living in an area that gets cold and snowy. I did have a bit of what I suspect to be Seasonal Affective Disorder, but a little vitamin D seemed to clear it right up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri_snow.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri_snow&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timing barely worked, but before leaving the area, we were able to get both doses of our COVID vaccines. The first we just had some arm soreness, but the second dose hit me pretty hard with chills and a fever of 102. James was just a little tired, so it worked out that he was able to keep Ezri happy while I recovered. Still well worth the safety, obviously. While we were waiting for the vaccines, James also had to get a little dental surgery for his front teeth, luckily the timing worked out for that and we were able to get all the appointments taken care of before leaving the area!. It&amp;rsquo;s certainly nice to have a friend in the industry (Cindy) to help keep us taken care of!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;teeth.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;teeth&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On May 1st we left out to the first stop for this year, Athens, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Halloween in Champaign-Urbana Illinois, but Winter is Coming...</title>
      <link>https://www.colefamily.page/posts/2020-12-21/champaign.html</link>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;champaign-urbana-illinois-oct-30-nov-14&#34;&gt;Champaign-Urbana, Illinois (Oct 30 - Nov 14)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri-kite-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri-kite-2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Champaign Illinois is a larger town of 88k people. It&amp;rsquo;s home to the University of Illinois, so it has a lot of the same cultural, restaurant, and cycling amenities that come with it. We arrived the day before Halloween, and found a drive-thru trunk or treat the same night. After waiting in line for over an hour, we made it through and Ezri was very excited to get candy and talk to the people handing it out. On Halloween day we found an event at the local library where Ezri got to pick out a book in addition to a treat bag, then we figured we&amp;rsquo;d hit one more drive thru that started in the afternoon. That turned out to be a less good idea, we got in line at the exact time the event was supposed to start, and after waiting in line for 2.5 hours (.5 hours after it was supposed to end), we reached the start to be told they were out of candy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;facepaint.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;facepaint&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;dressed-up1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dressed-up1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;dressed-up2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dressed-up2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The park we stayed at has a pond that we enjoyed walking around, and 3 cats who like to follow whoever is near one end of the pond. If Ezri had her way, we&amp;rsquo;d have spent almost all our time out there petting cats. We are slowly getting used to it, but there are so many more bugs around than there were in Vegas. There were a lot of Asian Lady-beetles in the area, and they kept letting themselves into the house. Ezri loves having them as pets, so we caught them in jars for her, then got an actual bug box and got nearly 15 at once. I have to admit, we then didn&amp;rsquo;t have any food for them and forgot to let them loose outside in time. Luckily they are an invasive species, so I guess we can say we did our part. We&amp;rsquo;ll continue trying to remember to let her friends go before it&amp;rsquo;s too late, but that&amp;rsquo;s usually met with tears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;pond.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;pond&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri-pond.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri-pond&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri-is-doggy.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri-is-doggy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in the area, we discovered a high-school friend of our friend Paul Grayson lived nearby, so we met up with them and their kids at the playground for some masked, mostly distanced socializing. They filled us in on some of the amenities. The school system is ranked highly, and has full immersion Spanish available at two of the private schools. There are restaurants of all kinds, though with the restrictions we weren&amp;rsquo;t able to try more than a few while in town. It&amp;rsquo;s clear they really enjoy the area, and near the University definitely has a lot of the stuff we are looking for, though land prices that close are also too high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri-park.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri-park&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri-park1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri-park1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons we chose to visit this area is that James recently got a new Step-mom, Peggy, and Champaign is within a few hours of her hometown where she and his dad are living. We met halfway between, at an outdoor zoo, and had lunch at a Mexican restaurant afterwards. The zoo had a wide assortment of animals, including a &amp;lsquo;petting zoo&amp;rsquo; area where we could feed them some pellet food through the fence. Ezri liked feeding the goats, and we got close to getting the deer to eat, but there were 2 pushy cows that kept nosing all the other animals away. The cows were also the drooliest eaters, so Ezri quickly decided she didn&amp;rsquo;t like feeding them. We had to divide and conquer, with James distracting the cows with snacks so Ezri and I could feed the goats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri-mom-zoo.jpg.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri-mom-zoo.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri-dad-zoo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri-dad-zoo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri-deer.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri-deer&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri-goat.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri-goat&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;grandpa-ezri.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;grandpa-ezri&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we were driving back, we stopped at a gas station with some concrete spheres to separate the sidewalk from the parking lot, and Ezri insisted it was time for a photo shoot. We also happened upon a damaged windmill, which was a crazy sight, with just how big those things are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri-ball.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri-ball&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;broken-windmill.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;broken-windmill&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;winter-destination-milan-michigan-nov-14-spring-2021&#34;&gt;Winter Destination: Milan, Michigan (Nov 14 - Spring 2021 ?)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;mi-park-swing.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;mi-park-swing&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We left on November 14th, and have settled into Milan, Michigan for the winter. My sister, Emily, lives nearby and we spent Thanksgiving with her family. It&amp;rsquo;s been wonderful being near them, though Ezri has made it clear the real reason she wants to visit so often and never leave is their 3 cats. Her cousin, Vera, has a birthday near hers, and we&amp;rsquo;ll be celebrating with a joint birthday party for them this weekend. Ezri is old enough now that she understands the concept of surprises and has asked that her cake be a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll share more in our next blog post!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cheesy Jokes in Madison Wisconsin</title>
      <link>https://www.colefamily.page/posts/2020-11-11/madison.html</link>

      <description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;deforest-madison-suburbs&#34;&gt;DeForest (Madison Suburbs)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri_mexican.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri_mexican&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeForest is a suburb of about 9k people North of Madison, Wisconsin. We were eager to check out the Madison area as it is one of the few places in the US that has a car crash testing site, which is the type of work my sister, Emily does. If we decided to live in the area, there&amp;rsquo;s a chance we could eventually convince her to join us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The area itself has a good amount of trails and I loved the proximity to Target and Jo-Ann&amp;rsquo;s (I&amp;rsquo;ve been sewing a lot more this season). The trade-off, unfortunately, is that the land and house prices are quite a bit higher, and outside of what our ideal would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri_jacket_2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri_jacket_2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri_jacket.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri_jacket&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RV Park we stayed at had a playground on-site, so we spent a ton of time there with Ezri. She also enjoyed playing in the leaves since fall was in full effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri_leaves.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri_leaves&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;madison&#34;&gt;Madison&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;madison_1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;madison_1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We drove into Madison proper, which has a population of 260k, but didn&amp;rsquo;t spend a ton of time since most things are shut down and we had a bit of a cold snap during our visit. We were excited to see some really good street art, but overall the city center felt very crowded and busy, with a lot of traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;wisconsin-dells&#34;&gt;Wisconsin Dells&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;sunset.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;sunset&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we talked to people in the area, a few recommended we check out Wisconsin Dells, so we drove up there. The city itself has less than 3k residents, but is primarily a tourist destination. We were surprised by how many water-parks were there, one after the other, indoor, outdoor, and with amusement park rides as well. We also passed a ropes course that looked like a ton of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original draw for tourists to Wis Dells (the short name we&amp;rsquo;ve seen used several places) is the Wisconsin river that cuts through the center. The day we drove out there was pretty chilly, but we were lucky to find a boat with 2 decks, one enclosed with a heater and one open air. The boat tour took us up the river to 2 different stops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;river.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;river&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first stop was Witches Gulch, named due to the strange rock/whirlpool formations and beliefs of the local Natives that it was haunted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;hiking.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;hiking&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second stop was at a rock formation made famous when a photographer caught a picture of their son jumping across a gap onto a precarious looking rock tower. They had a trained dog jump across, and we tried to time our pictures to catch the mid-air moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;rocks.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;rocks&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the boat ride, we grabbed dinner at a restaurant with a model train track running through it. We assumed it was just there for decoration, until we saw it go by loaded with drinks. They use the train to deliver each table&amp;rsquo;s drinks, appetizers, and small entrées.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;train1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;train1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;train2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;train2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;halloween-prep&#34;&gt;Halloween Prep&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Halloween is just around the corner the day after we arrive in Champaign, Illinois, so I spent time working on a new skeleton costume for Ezri, she&amp;rsquo;s been really into anatomy this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;costume_1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;costume_1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;costume_2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;costume_2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;costume_3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;costume_3&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James and Ezri carved 2 pumpkins this year, Ezri is very aware of emotions now and had a lot of fun planning the face each would have. Ezri wanted the first pumpkin to be spookier, she&amp;rsquo;s really been getting into the spirit with all the Halloween decorations at the store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;pumpkin_0.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;pumpkin_0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;pumpkin_3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;pumpkin_3&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;pumpkin_2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;pumpkin_2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;pumpkin_1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;pumpkin_1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all for this update, until next time!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wind Powered Excitement in Pella and Knoxville Iowa</title>
      <link>https://www.colefamily.page/posts/2020-10-29/knoxville_pella.html</link>

      <guid>https://www.colefamily.page/posts/2020-10-29/knoxville_pella.html</guid>
      <description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;knoxville-iowa&#34;&gt;Knoxville, Iowa&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knoxville is a pretty small town (about 7k people), and doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot going on other than the sprint car raceway and museum they have. We stayed about a mile from a nice park, so Ezri had us walking to the playground frequently. If she had her way, we&amp;rsquo;d do nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri_rainbow.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri_rainbow&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing we noticed about this area is that the towns all seem to have a central square with city hall, and their main street surrounds the square. They had a farmer&amp;rsquo;s market 2x a week in the square, and we went once; there were only a few stalls, but we bought a bunch of green peppers as we&amp;rsquo;ve all been on a pepper salad kick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather has been really nice, so I got a decent amount of running in, and we also tried to walk whenever we could. During one of our walks we came across the creepiest lion statue we&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen in front of a veterinary office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;james_lion.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;james_lion&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During one of my runs, I noticed a bat in the middle of the sidewalk. I stopped, called James, and discussed what to do, we decided to see if it was still there on my way back. Sure enough, poor guy was still there, and refused to move from the sidewalk. I tried gently prodding with a stick but it just showed its teeth rather than move. I finished my run, then we doubled back with the car, a box, and some rags to gather it up. We contacted a rescue and were instructed to try putting it on a tree, so we picked one on the edge of the RV park that we could check back on, and tried it. We were shocked by how quickly the bat went from unmoving to climbing happily up the tree. Turns out if they fly during the day they get easily disoriented and scared, and are unable to take off from the ground, so they just kind of hunker down and wait until night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;bat.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bat&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little ways north is Cordova Park, which has an observation tower you can climb for $.50 a person. We paid our quarters, went in, and noticed a bunch of ladybugs all over the tower. Then came the biting gnats, and as we got up a little higher, the yellow jackets. I guess we didn&amp;rsquo;t pick the best time of year, but we only spent a few seconds at the top before hurrying back down to avoid all the flying pests. I was a little disappointed as the views would have been really nice had we had the time to enjoy them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;tower.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tower&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;tower_inside.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tower_inside&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;pella-iowa&#34;&gt;Pella, Iowa&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;pella_downtown.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;pella_downtown&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;pella_fountain.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;pella_fountain&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we had been able to find an RV park in Pella, I think that&amp;rsquo;s where we would have stayed, the town has more potential for us long term than Knoxville. Pella is a very unique town of about 10k people, settled by a religious group from the Netherlands in 1847. They have held onto their Dutch heritage, with many buildings in the center of town built with Dutch architecture, a yearly tulip festival, a canal in the middle of the street, and a working windmill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;pella_windmill.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;pella_windmill&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took a tour of the windmill and surrounding museum, which included:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A massive mini train village of buildings found in the Netherlands&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;tiny_town.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tiny_town&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several preserved historical buildings from the early days of the town&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;water_wheel.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;water_wheel&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;village.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;village&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some giant shoes that Ezri loved trying on&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;shoes.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;shoes&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pella may be a familiar name to you, the main company in town is Pella windows, with some of the towns income coming from tourism as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also enjoyed having Poffertjes (tiny pancakes covered in powdered sugar) and Stroopwafels at the local chain coffee shop, DutchFix. When telling locals of our travels and the reason for them, the most common response we got is &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;ll love it here, the schools are great and there are a lot of churches!&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;bridge1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bridge1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yankton spans across the state line, though most of the city is in South Dakota. The RV park we stayed in is right next to a 2 layer former rail/car bridge that is now strictly for pedestrians. We were about a mile from the downtown via the bridge, so we used it quite a bit. Underneath the bridge, they also have a few miles of rough trail that Ezri and I ran on. It was enjoyable, and she thought it was extra fun with all of the bumps and turns, but I ran face first into several spiderwebs, one with the spider still in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;trail.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;trail&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;bridge2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bridge2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also had easy access to the Missouri River, with nice sandy banks that we attempted to make sand castles on, but ultimately couldn&amp;rsquo;t get the moisture level correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri_water.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri_water&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Yankton downtown is nice, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t have as much going on as some of the other places we&amp;rsquo;ve been. There&amp;rsquo;s not a lot of foot traffic or the type of businesses you window shop at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in Yankton, we officially became South Dakotans! We got new licenses, but were surprised to find out that they don&amp;rsquo;t have a DMV; licenses and registration are handled by 2 completely different departments. We should have registered our vehicles while in the Black Hills, so James had to make a flight from our current stop to take care of the truck and RV, while I&amp;rsquo;ll make a flight later on to get the car switched over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;james_plane.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;james_plane&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason we switched residency mostly comes down to the registration, in Nevada we were paying about 3x as much, and they required a Nevada smog check each year, that we can&amp;rsquo;t get since we aren&amp;rsquo;t near there. In South Dakota we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to renew each year without worrying about smog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;vermillion-sd&#34;&gt;Vermillion, SD&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;castle.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;castle&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vermillion is about a half hour from Yankton, so we also checked out the area there. Overall, we liked Vermillion a little better, there are a few more interesting things and it&amp;rsquo;s a bit more progressive, probably due to the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s a college town. They aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to mandate masks due to state rules, but they have a &amp;lsquo;masks expected&amp;rsquo; policy. We also saw several rainbow signs in business windows showing support for LGBTQ rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;mask.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;mask&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;rights.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;rights&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vermillion&amp;rsquo;s main street has the only breakfast place we could find that is open on Sunday (between both Vermillion and Yankton) and is very walkable with a few more browsable shops than Yankton had. They also have a gorgeous old church that looks like a castle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also on the main street we found a robotics club for kids that Ezri wanted to join immediately. She&amp;rsquo;s a bit too young, but it&amp;rsquo;s nice to see STEM related things like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;robotics.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;robotics&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a hard time finding any fabric stores in the area with anything besides quilting fabric, so we made the hour&amp;rsquo;s drive to Hawarden, Iowa to a fabric outlet. It was interesting seeing this tiny town with hardly anything going on with such a large fabric store. I overheard other customers and it seems many drive hours to get there. I got some &amp;lsquo;water damaged&amp;rsquo; denim for 1.99 a yard and corduroy for 2.99 a yard that should keep me busy for a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;in-weave.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;in-weave&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;fabric.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;fabric&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Black Hills of South Dakota (Lead / Deadwood / Rapid City)</title>
      <link>https://www.colefamily.page/posts/2020-09-28/black_hills.html</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;blackhills_ezri.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;blackhills_ezri&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we stayed mostly in Deadwood, the whole area needs to be taken into account, so I&amp;rsquo;ve broken up some of this by city. This area has a lot of history so I&amp;rsquo;ll include some as it&amp;rsquo;s really necessary to see why we chose to visit and why it is now our top spot on our ranking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;spearfish&#34;&gt;Spearfish&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed a few days in Spearfish, due to the site in Deadwood not being available yet. We were able to find an RV park with a walking path that connected to a larger paved bike path. Ezri and I did a couple runs and walks through there and she found a love for trying to imitate the buzzing insects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;spearfish_trail.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;spearfish_trail&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This RV park also has daily ice cream socials, $3 a person for all you can eat, and we were thrilled to find it was outdoors and properly distanced. It was a really great way to meet and chat with our fellow RVers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;spearfish_koa.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;spearfish_koa&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spearfish is a medium small town, with about 10k people, and large enough to have a decent selection of restaurants, chain grocery stores, and a Wal-Mart. It&amp;rsquo;s only about a 25 minute drive from Deadwood, so our next hop was a short one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;spearfish_goodday.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;spearfish_goodday&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;spearfish_hatchery.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;spearfish_hatchery&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the cheap tires that came with the RV decided to develop bubbles already, so we also had to upgrade them while at our next stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;cheap_tires.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;cheap_tires&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;deadwood&#34;&gt;Deadwood&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;deadwood_mansion.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;deadwood_mansion&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed in an RV park nestled into a gulch for the rest of the 3 weeks we were in the area, and practically on the George S. Mickelson Trail, 108.8 miles of dirt trail that follows a former railroad. Perfect for running, walking, cycling, and open to snowmobiles in the winter, this is one of the reasons we wanted to check out the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;deadwood_rv_park.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;deadwood_rv_park&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;deadwod_trail.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;deadwod_trail&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deadwood is a small town of 1300, and has a famous history as an old west town, with a cemetery near the top of a mountain that has the graves of Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, and Seth Bullock. Around that area is also a hiking trail that Ezri and I took; though we accidentally went off trail and nearly doubled the distance, we had a lot of fun and there were some really great views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;deadwood_ezri_sitting.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;deadwood_ezri_sitting&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the old West history, Deadwood&amp;rsquo;s main income source is tourism, and they have a great downtown with a lot of activities (though some are shut down due to covid). Every Thursday night is family night at the open air stage, and almost every day they have reenacted shootouts on main street every 2 hours for the tourists. There are also casinos with single deck blackjack, cheap prime rib buffets, and James says it really reminds him of old Vegas, back when he first got there. There&amp;rsquo;s also a coffee shop/glass blowing studio with some gorgeous pieces. They normally have glass blowing classes too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;deadwood_glass_one.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;deadwood_glass_one&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;deadwood_glass_two.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;deadwood_glass_two&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The area is very mountainous, so most of the houses are built multi-storied, with small footprints and tiny yards. They also frequently will have stairs leading from the street to the house, as nearly all are up on a hillside. Garages are rare, and almost never attached, instead being next to the street. This makes for a very unique aesthetic that I really loved, so much so that when I found a house in town, with over 10 acres (impossible!), I convinced James we had to at least check it out, with the idea of possibly buying, renting out the house while we continue on our journey, then returning and building a new house on the other acreage, or selling the whole thing if we decided on a different area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;deadwood_house.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;deadwood_house&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We contacted a Realtor, and, perhaps luckily, found that the property has very little land that is close enough to flat to use, and the house needs more work than we&amp;rsquo;d be willing to do, especially remotely. I was a little bummed, but it&amp;rsquo;s ultimately for the best as we want to see more places before locking ourselves in somewhere. There&amp;rsquo;s also a challenge with older buildings in the area, as they are under special historic zoning and any changes have to go through a review board. Definitely not something we&amp;rsquo;d want to navigate from a remote position on top of the regular risks of hiring people to do work without being able to check it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;deadwood_ezri_park.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;deadwood_ezri_park&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a nice playground in Deadwood too, a little over a mile from the RV park, so we ended a few runs there so she could get some play time in. Running in the area definitely gave me a challenge with elevation change, especially because the RV park is higher up so every run ended in a steep uphill. The RV Park also has it&amp;rsquo;s own history, with an abandoned mine on the property. We got to see some of the old machinery, and I found a rock with what I think is a little gold in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;deadwood_ezri_mining.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;deadwood_ezri_mining&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temperature can change pretty rapidly there, we went from 80 degree days to 8ish inches of snow and back again over about a week&amp;rsquo;s span. Ezri of course loved the snow, but we quickly realized blue jeans aren&amp;rsquo;t sufficient snow gear, as they got soaked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the day after Labor Day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;deadwood_rv_park_snow.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;deadwood_rv_park_snow&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;rsquo;s three days later:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;deadwood_rv_park_after.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;deadwood_rv_park_after&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lead&#34;&gt;Lead&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;lead_homestake.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;lead_homestake&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lead (pronounced &amp;ldquo;leed&amp;rdquo;, named after mining &amp;ldquo;leads&amp;rdquo;) is a small town of about 3,000 about 10 minutes from Deadwood, and has a lot of mining history. The Homestake Mine was started in 1876, and until it closed down in 2002, was the deepest mine in North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;lead_train.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;lead_train&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;lead_train_ezri.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;lead_train_ezri&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it was shut down, the town suffered and started to decline, but then in 2006, the Sanford Lab came to town and wanted to use the mine for neutrino research. Due to the depth of the mine, they are able to do research with far less white noise to have to account for. You can read more about it here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sanfordlab.org/&#34;&gt;https://www.sanfordlab.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;lead_mine.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;lead_mine&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the deal, the Sanford lab put $20mil towards education reform in Lead/Deadwood (they share a single school district), which they plan to use to incorporate more STEM in the schools. There is also a newsletter that is sent to all Lead residents when the lab has updates on their projects, and they host monthly deep talks (until Covid-19, that is) with the community. The influx of STEM related education and people is something we find very appealing, and rare within such a small town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;lead_train2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;lead_train2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;lead_mine_tank.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;lead_mine_tank&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lead&amp;rsquo;s downtown is walkable, though less tourist-focused than Deadwood. One thing we are finding with smaller towns, is the lack of regular open hours on businesses. There is one store in Lead that has ice cream and who knows what else that we wanted to see, but it was always closed anytime we had time (like the weekend), then we&amp;rsquo;d see it open on the way to dinner or some other off hour that we didn&amp;rsquo;t have the time to stop. Maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll make it back there to see it later on in our journey. There&amp;rsquo;s also a mine between Lead and Deadwood that you can tour underground and pan for gold that I wanted to see; we put it off one weekend, only to see &amp;lsquo;Closed for the season&amp;rsquo; posted afterwards, so that&amp;rsquo;s another one for if we make it back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;lead_bank.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;lead_bank&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lead has a non-chain grocery store with a good selection, so we shopped there most of the time rather than making the drive to Spearfish. In the same building is a coffee shop that has become a bit of a community hangout spot; the owner lets people sign the entryway, and has tchotchkes and toys on display that have been brought in. We had a Las Vegas magnet that we added to the collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;lead_coffee.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;lead_coffee&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lead has a very vibrant Arts community, and there is even a Makerspace in the process of opening up! We&amp;rsquo;d love to be involved if we end up back in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;lead_makerspace.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;lead_makerspace&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An antique piece of Artwork in a church that is now an Arts &amp;amp; Crafts shop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;lead_arts.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;lead_arts&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lead also has an opera house that normally has events at least every month. The list of events for the area has at least 4 things every month, from 5ks, snowshoe walks, and bicycle rides to parades and play performances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;lead_opera.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;lead_opera&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;rapid-city&#34;&gt;Rapid City&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;rapidcity_derpy_bront.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;rapidcity_derpy_bront&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nearest big-ish city for the area is Rapid City, with 75,000 people. It&amp;rsquo;s about 45 minutes drive from Deadwood. They have a dinosaur park that was built in the 30s, and from our observations, the artist must have been working from memory, as the inaccuracies were quite bad. Ezri loved it though, and since the dinosaurs are made of concrete, they allow the kids to play on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;rapidcity_derpy_dino.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;rapidcity_derpy_dino&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;rapidcity_derpy_trex.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;rapidcity_derpy_trex&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;rapidcity_derpy_triceratops.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;rapidcity_derpy_triceratops&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also went to a dinosaur museum that was more scientific, but Ezri got a bit scared as most of their exhibits were dinosaurs with the skin on, and she much prefers just the bones. Still, they had a digging area at the end with fake eggs and bones to uncover through the rubber &amp;lsquo;dirt&amp;rsquo;. She spent a long time there, and was upset when we finally left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;rapidcity_ezri_dig.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;rapidcity_ezri_dig&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;rapidcity_ezri_dig_home.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;rapidcity_ezri_dig_home&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing we found really odd is that the hotels in the area are apparently competing for who has the longest water-slide. Signs like &amp;lsquo;146 foot water-slide&amp;rsquo; were on each hotel we went past, with the water-slides jutting out from a corner of the hotel. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if this is a pretty normal thing, but it was a first for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rapid City has all your big city amenities, like Target and several sporting goods stores. There&amp;rsquo;s no Costco, but that&amp;rsquo;s not really something that&amp;rsquo;s very high up on our lists anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;next-stop&#34;&gt;Next Stop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pulled into our next stop, South Yankton Nebraska (Yankton South Dakota somewhat spans across the state lines) last week, and we&amp;rsquo;ll be staying 2 weeks here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;yankton.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;yankton&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;sunset.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;sunset&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bozeman-montana&#34;&gt;Bozeman, Montana&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed in 2 separate RV parks in Bozeman, as we couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a continuous reservation available. Our first 2 days, we were at the Bozeman Hot Springs and Campground, but unfortunately we did not try the hot springs as they were busy with people not distancing or wearing masks. There was a playground right near our site though, so Ezri really enjoyed going there each day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri_tube.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri_tube&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, we moved to Bear Canyon Campground for the rest of our stay, on the Southeast side of Bozeman. Being a little ways outside of town was less than ideal, as we found that most roads around Bozeman don&amp;rsquo;t have much, if any, shoulder. Right near us was a road that dead ended, but you could only get about 2 miles out before it ended. Overall, there were some good trails, but they were more mountain bike than manicured, and not well connected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;sunset2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;sunset2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;sunset_ezri.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;sunset_ezri&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bozeman has a great walkable downtown with good restaurants, so that was a definite plus. Parking could be a little challenging, but that comes with a more populous area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;bookstore.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bookstore&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to the Museum of the Rockies twice while in Bozeman, Ezri has been really obsessed with bones lately (learning their names, asking if other people/animals have them, wanting me to take mine out so she can touch them, you know, normal stuff). Luckily they have a big collection of dinosaur bones, as well as reptile exhibits and an old homestead to tour. There&amp;rsquo;s also a planetarium star show, and with limited capacity due to distancing, we had to plan our second visit specifically to make the show. We got about 2 minutes in when the darkness and video of the inside of your head made Ezri too freaked out to continue. Maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll try a show like that again in a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;trex_attack.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;trex_attack&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some great hiking trails in the surrounding area, so we picked a short, 1 mile out and back to see if Ezri will tolerate the hiking pack we have. Last time we used it, about a year and a half ago, she was too upset by being restricted and screamed until she fell asleep. This time, she fully understood the concept of being comfortably carried, loved the view from up high, and has been asking to hike again frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;james_ezri.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;james_ezri&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;james_ezri2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;james_ezri2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri_rebecca.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri_rebecca&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bozeman tends to be a little drier than I want for plants and gardening, and the land prices are also a bit higher than we&amp;rsquo;d like. We&amp;rsquo;re pretty sure it&amp;rsquo;s off the list for future places to live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sheridan-wyoming&#34;&gt;Sheridan, Wyoming&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;rv_setup.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;rv_setup&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drive from Bozeman to Sheridan was supposed to be right within our regular pull, just shy of 4 hours drive time with a stop at the halfway point taking it to 4.5ish. This was not in the cards for us, unfortunately, and we ended up having to stop an additional 3 times for potty breaks (2 of them false alarms). Our total time ended up being a little over 6 hours, so we all arrived a teensy bit grumpy. Luckily, our reserved site was a pull-through, which is super easy to get the RV into. We lucked out too, that we were right next to the playground in the park, so Ezri had a lot of fun during our stay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;tricycle2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tricycle2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;tricycle.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tricycle&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are paved paths that cover a good amount of the city, but with highs in the upper 90s to over 100, we didn&amp;rsquo;t get out on them many times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;dad_park.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dad_park&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downtown is walkable and has some nice restaurants, one of which has a aquaponics installation we really liked. It&amp;rsquo;s the first time we&amp;rsquo;ve seen a setup that had taken looks into account, and Ezri loved watching the fish in the bottom of it. Definitely going to be filing that away for future consideration once we have a house, as I think something like that could go well on our back porch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;aquaponics.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;aquaponics&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;aquaponics2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;aquaponics2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the high heat and dry climate, Sheridan is also going to be out of the running for our final home, but we enjoyed our time there for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;horns.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;horns&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;horn_money.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;horn_money&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Sheridan, we drove 3 hours to Spearfish, South Dakota (for a two-day stay before Deadwood / Lead), with, thankfully, only 1 potty break.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kalispell and Helena Montana</title>
      <link>https://www.colefamily.page/posts/2020-08-02/kalispell_helena.html</link>

      <description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;kalispell-montana&#34;&gt;Kalispell, Montana&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;somers.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;somers&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;lake_dad_ezri.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;lake_dad_ezri&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kalispell is definitely a contender for us, it has friendly people and beautiful landscapes. The weather proves to a be a little unpredictable: due to the mountains in the area, high winds whip through periodically and the weather can change rapidly. One day we went from blue sunny skies to high winds, rain, and hail within about 3 hours. Definitely makes for some excitement, but also some frustration; we got all dressed for a bike ride one morning only to have it start raining the second we got in the saddle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;lead.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;lead&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;whitehead.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;whitehead&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of bike riding, we finally got everything in place to go on a family ride. Due to the spike in demand for bicycles, we had a heck of a time finding the bike trailer we wanted for Ezri. It allows her to pedal while also being more of a chair with safety straps so we can be sure she won&amp;rsquo;t fall off. We only went for 10 miles as we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to push either Ezri or myself too hard, but it was very enjoyable, and she definitely wants to go more often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;bike.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bike&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;rbike.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;rbike&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bike trails made for excellent runs, walks, and rides. We&amp;rsquo;re going to miss them now that we&amp;rsquo;ve left the area. Unlike in some places we&amp;rsquo;ve been, the trails are quite long and decently interconnected. Kila, which is about 15 miles outside of Kalispell, could be reached by cycling trails from where we stayed. If we decide to move to the area, Kila is probably where we&amp;rsquo;d end up settling. It&amp;rsquo;s a very small town, with 20+ acre parcels available for good prices, and still easy to access the amenities of Kalispell nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;railstotrails.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;railstotrails&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;biketrail.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;biketrail&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While checking out the area, we came across a Fire Station fund-raiser, and were able to climb inside some of the fire trucks. Ezri had a blast pretending to drive, but was disappointed they weren&amp;rsquo;t going to let us take them for an actual spin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;firetruck.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;firetruck&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri_drive.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri_drive&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;lake_rebecca_ezri.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;lake_rebecca_ezri&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We visited the &amp;lsquo;Miracle of America&amp;rsquo; museum, which had a little of everything to look at. We felt like we could have come back and spent another 10 hours and still likely not seen everything. One of our favorite things was some working Nickelodeon pianos they had that still accepted quarters, and a boat ride that worked on dimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri_tractor.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri_tractor&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri_boat.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri_boat&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri_desk.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri_desk&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glacier National Park is one of the reasons a lot of people would see Kalispell, we drove up one day, but unfortunately the best part of the park, &amp;lsquo;Going to the Sun Road&amp;rsquo; was closed. We still visited the beach of the river for a while, and Ezri had a lot of fun playing in the sand and water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;river.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;river&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;river_bucket.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;river_bucket&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day before we had to leave town, James got up super early and rode his bike up the &amp;lsquo;Going to the Sun Road&amp;rsquo;, as they allow bicycles while it is still closed to cars. It was about 42 miles round trip, but the steep part was 3000 feet of climbing in 10 miles. You can see his &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.strava.com/activities/3747732304&#34;&gt;Strava ride here with a lot more pictures&lt;/a&gt; than just those below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;glacier2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;glacier2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;glacier_tunnel.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;glacier_tunnel&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;glacier3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;glacier3&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;glacier.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;glacier&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day after we left Kalispell, they opened the rest of Glacier to cars. I&amp;rsquo;m bummed I missed seeing the best parts, but glad James was able to do his epic bike ride before we left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;helena-montana&#34;&gt;Helena, Montana&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;helena_a.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;helena_a&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next stop was Helena, Montana, for 2 weeks. This one was added by me, as looking online, I thought this was a real potential candidate. Helena is the capitol of Montana, and was at one point the richest city in the state due to successful mining operations. There are some beautiful old houses and buildings in their downtown area, and they have a walkable section that is closed off to cars and lined with cute shops and restaurants. We bought a few more games for Ezri than we probably should have at a toy store there, and I bought a half pound of chocolates at a chocolate shop that I&amp;rsquo;m now trying to not to eat all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helena has an average of 300 sunny days a year, so it&amp;rsquo;s dry and the natural vegetation tends more towards sagebrush than trees or grasses. Some of the lots we looked at were up at the edge of the mountains and reminded me a lot of Mt. Charleston outside of Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;helena_ride.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;helena_ride&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;helena_ride2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;helena_ride2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took Ezri to the Black Sandy State Park on the edge of Lake Helena and spent a few hours in the water. She was having a great time until she went a little too far out, slipped, and dunked herself. Even so, anytime we go near or mention any kind of water, she wants to go dip her toes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;helena_lake.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;helena_lake&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri_helena_pbj.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri_helena_pbj&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, while Helena was nice and the people were friendly, it was just too deserty. While there, though, we heard from multiple people that we HAD to check out Bozeman, Montana. We were able to finagle the schedule, and that is our next stop.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Social Distancing in Joseph Oregon</title>
      <link>https://www.colefamily.page/posts/2020-06-20/joseph.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.colefamily.page/posts/2020-06-20/joseph.html</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;joseph1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;joseph1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whew! Time really flies, been meaning to write another post for a while. We just left Joseph, Oregon after staying there about 3 months. With things mostly shut down, we decided it was best to hunker down in one place until things started opening back up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joseph is just north of Wallowa Lake, and we made it to the north end of the lake a few times for Ezri to play in the water. If she had her way, we&amp;rsquo;d never leave. We spent an hour on a rented paddle boat out on the South end of the lake, Ezri alternated between helping pedal and leaning over the edge to pick up sticks or splash in the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri_lake.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri_lake&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joseph has a very walkable, picturesque Main Street we both ran and walked up and down many times. Our RV Park was just off of Main Street, so having direct access was really nice. There are bronze sculptures all around the town, and Ezri&amp;rsquo;s favorite by far is a mom and baby horse &amp;lsquo;hugging&amp;rsquo;. She insisted we get a picture in front of them. There are a few different restaurants we enjoyed, an old style soda fountain and ice cream shop, and a chocolate shop I got a few too many chocolate truffles from. The mix of small town and tourist attraction made for a really nice culture, and I think we&amp;rsquo;ll have a hard time topping the welcoming, well maintained main street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri_horses.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri_horses&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first month, we were almost the only ones in the RV park, but after that we got some lovely neighbors who we had a lot of fun talking with, Anna and Jeanne (from 6 feet of course!). We have missed having close connections while on the road, and it was so nice to make some friends. They also gave me an awesome haircut as a parting gift, which I&amp;rsquo;m really enjoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;anna_joanne.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;anna_joanne&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;family_table.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;family_table&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had Easter in Joseph, and were worried Ezri would miss having other kids around for egg hunting. We should have known she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mind at all; she was too focused on finding all the eggs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;easter.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;easter&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Ezri getting a little older, I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to start doing more projects, so I&amp;rsquo;ve made a few masks for us, as well as 2 dresses for Ezri. I&amp;rsquo;ve restarted a half-done knitting project too, and am looking forward to wrapping it up and starting on another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;mask.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;mask&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;dress.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dress&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James has gotten back on his bike, to discover that a road bike and dirt roads don&amp;rsquo;t go together very well. He upgraded to a gravel bike (James says: &lt;a href=&#34;https://salsacycles.com/bikes/warroad/2019_warroad_carbon_force_1_650&#34;&gt;2019 Salsa Warroad Force 1 650b&lt;/a&gt; with a 48T chainring upgrade + Power2Max NGEco power meter), and convinced me to get a new gravel bike too. We also got Ezri a trailer that lets her help pedal. She has been practicing on it, but the weather turned cold and windy right as we got it, so we haven&amp;rsquo;t gone out as a family yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;james.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;james&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;bike.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;bike&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an old railroad that cuts through the edge of Joseph but no longer has trains on it. It&amp;rsquo;s great for walking on, and there&amp;rsquo;s a company that has pedal cars you can rent to take on it too. By the time they were allowed to reopen, we only had 1 weekend to try them, and it got too windy and cold, so we&amp;rsquo;ve got something on the list to do next time we&amp;rsquo;re in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;railroad.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;railroad&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, Joseph has friendly people and beautiful views, though it lacks diversity and access to stores (the nearest big box is WalMart in La Grande, over 1.5 hours away). We also would have about a 2 hour drive to the nearest airport, and while James isn&amp;rsquo;t traveling weekly anymore, he&amp;rsquo;ll still be visiting clients about once a quarter post-covid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-states-in-under-48-hours&#34;&gt;4 states in under 48 hours&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;family.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;family&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;rv.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;rv&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving Joseph, we decided to break our trip into 2 days rather than make the nearly 8 hour drive in one. We drove from Oregon, through Washington, then stopped overnight in Coeur D&amp;rsquo;Alene, Idaho in an RV park with lake access. Ezri played in the water even though it was a little chilly. The RV park was nice, but huge compared to the tiny one we came from. It felt strange to see so many RVs and people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;ezri_cda.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ezri_cda&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, we grabbed breakfast and headed out to our current location: Kalispell, Montana. Kalispell is a smallish town of about 30,000 people, with amenities like Target, Costco, and JoAnn&amp;rsquo;s. The RV park we chose &lt;a href=&#34;https://montanabasecamp.com/&#34;&gt;Montana Basecamp&lt;/a&gt; is on a well maintained bike/jogging path; we don&amp;rsquo;t even need to get on a road to access it from the RV park. We plan to stay here for a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;basecamp.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;basecamp&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proving that the world is much smaller than we think, James saw a familiar Wi-Fi access point while setting up, to discover his coworker and fellow RVer Michael Kidd and his wife Lehnanne is staying a few sites down from us&amp;hellip; We actually first met them in person about a year ago in Las Vegas just before buying our fifth wheel! It was great back then talking about what living on the road would be like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check out their travel blog at &lt;a href=&#34;https://turtleherding.com/&#34;&gt;https://turtleherding.com/&lt;/a&gt;. We look forward to catching up with them while we&amp;rsquo;re here!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Bumpy Road to Pacific City and Cascade Locks</title>
      <link>https://www.colefamily.page/posts/2020-04-11/bumpy.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 11 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://www.colefamily.page/posts/2020-04-11/bumpy.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Apologies, this is a little late, it was written on April 3rd; the next post about Joseph, OR will be forthcoming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our last few weeks in Fall City didn&amp;rsquo;t go as we had planned, as we got a call in the middle of the night that James&amp;rsquo;s step-mom, Kim, had passed away. Luckily James&amp;rsquo;s work has paid bereavement leave and my work can be flexible, allowing us to fly out to Tennessee to support his dad. The funeral was beautiful, and we were able to catch up with friends and family we didn&amp;rsquo;t see during our Christmas trip out there. We were all shocked by her passing, and will miss her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;tn_bug.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tn_bug&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James has transitioned within Red Hat to a new role of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/being-technical-account-manager-tam-day-life&#34;&gt;Technical Account Manager&lt;/a&gt; which is mostly remote and will only require travel a few times a quarter. We are very excited for the increased time we&amp;rsquo;ll spend together, and it&amp;rsquo;s nice to not have to worry about proximity to an airport when planning our stops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drive from Fall City to Pacific City Oregon was relatively uneventful. Some of the mountain roads had sunken grade and other damage that made for a bumpy ride. The RV Park we stayed in was really nice, and the stay was free for us since we have a membership to Thousand Trails. The membership cost just a little more than a 2 week stay, and gives us free stays in member RV parks as long as it&amp;rsquo;s been at least a week since we last were in one and we don&amp;rsquo;t stay longer than 14 days. It&amp;rsquo;ll be a while until we&amp;rsquo;re at a location with another Thousand Trails park, but we&amp;rsquo;ve already more than made up for the price of membership by staying 2 weeks free in Fall City, then 2 weeks free in Pacific City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;family_pacificcity.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;family_pacificcity&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pacific City is directly on the coast, and has some great local restaurants. We were able to walk directly from the RV Park to the beach. Ezri loved playing in the sand, even though it was a bit chilly and windy each time we went. When we first arrived, we opted to eat out more than normal, and I am so glad we did, since we barely beat the spread of COVID-19 and subsequent closing of dine-in areas. The people we talked to were friendly, and we discovered most of the houses in Pacific City are vacation rentals. Not sure how that would impact the overall culture, but it seemed a little too tourist heavy to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;pacificcity_rock.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;pacificcity_rock&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RV Park we stayed at is unfortunately in an area with minimal cell signal. We were unable to make/receive phone calls from our site; text messages were hit and miss. Luckily our AT&amp;amp;T connection we use for wifi was slightly stronger, and we had enough Internet to stay connected via hangouts and other tools, but to get any work done we had to either go to the Family Center or a nearby coffee shop. The Family Center has a pool table, ping pong, a few arcade games, and a room of toys for younger kids, as well as several tables and chairs, so I took Ezri there almost every day so she could play while I worked for an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few miles south of Pacific City is Lincoln City, we spent the day out there shopping in their outlet mall for new clothes for Ezri, since she&amp;rsquo;d pretty much outgrown all of her 2T stuff. The town seems more kid-friendly, one store had a table covered in sand and toys with a sign encouraging kids to play, and a coffee shop there had games out on every table. It was hard to get her to go with us into the clothing stores since all she wanted to do was play marbles again! Overall, I really enjoyed the vibe and availability of stores in Lincoln City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;North of Pacific City, we went up to Netarts and Oceanside. Both had some lovely restaurants with fresh seafood. Oceanside&amp;rsquo;s beach sometimes has geodes, so we walked along it looking for them. We found a few tiny ones, along with shells, and Ezri had fun digging in all of the rocks and sand. We also drove up a bit further to Cape Mears to the shortest, stubbiest lighthouse we&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With stricter directives that are practically a shelter in place order coming to Oregon, we spent the latter half of our stay mostly within the RV Park. They locked all of the buildings, so no more Family Center, but I got furloughed right around the same time and no longer had the need to work. James still needed to get work done, so he would drive the truck to the Family Center or the coffee shop, connect to their Wi-Fi, and work from within the truck. Not the most ideal situation, but it worked. Since we were inside so much, we decided it was the perfect time to potty train. Using the 3 day method right before a car trip wasn&amp;rsquo;t ideal, but we went for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, James&amp;rsquo;s brother, Joseph, ended up in the hospital while we were in Pacific City; hours from the nearest airport. We discussed having James fly out to see him, but were worried about potentially spreading COVID-19, as well as taking time off from a new job right after taking bereavement leave. James was at least able to use up his Southwest miles to fly out his mom and dad, but they were unable to get into the hospital when they arrived. Due to virus concerns, they shut it down to visitors. After a few days, Joseph was discharged and seems to be pretty much back to normal, which was a big relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our drive to the next stop, Cascade Locks, Oregon, was only about 3 hours. Since Ezri was so new to potty training, we planned a few stops. The first one was harder to get to than we&amp;rsquo;d thought, so we took a chance and skipped it. At the 2 hour mark we stopped at a McDonald&amp;rsquo;s for lunch and tried to have a potty break, to find that she is not OK using restaurant bathrooms. Afterwards, we drove the rest of the way to the RV Park, and then she used her little potty in the back of my car. I was shocked she made it about 3.5 hours without any accidents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been in Cascade Locks for about a week and a half, and will be leaving on Saturday. Technically the RV park we are in is closed, but the owners aren&amp;rsquo;t kicking out people like us who aren&amp;rsquo;t vacationers. The RV Park is right next to the railroad tracks, and while the trains were exciting initially, they run most often during the night and have woken us all up several times. We&amp;rsquo;re looking forward to getting a quiet night&amp;rsquo;s sleep at the next place. We are disappointed we haven&amp;rsquo;t really had an opportunity to check out the area or culture much, we can see some amazing cycling/walking/jogging trails by the highway and the maps show many trail-heads, but the weather has been a bit rainy and cold whenever we have the time to go, and the trail-heads look like they are closed anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;cascadelocks2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;cascadelocks2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next stop is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/travel/wallowa-valley-mountains-joseph-oregon-culture.html&#34;&gt;Joseph, Oregon&lt;/a&gt;. We originally planned to stay 2 weeks there, but are discussing whether we should stay until the socialization limitations are lifted, as the whole point of this journey is to get a feel for different places, and we aren&amp;rsquo;t able to do that without interacting with people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since we updated this post late, here&amp;rsquo;s a picture of part of the drive to Joseph, Oregon:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
