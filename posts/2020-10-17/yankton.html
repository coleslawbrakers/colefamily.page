<p>Yankton spans across the state line, though most of the city is in South Dakota. The RV park we stayed in is right next to a 2 layer former rail/car bridge that is now strictly for pedestrians. We were about a mile from the downtown via the bridge, so we used it quite a bit. Underneath the bridge, they also have a few miles of rough trail that Ezri and I ran on. It was enjoyable, and she thought it was extra fun with all of the bumps and turns, but I ran face first into several spiderwebs, one with the spider still in it.</p>

<p>We also had easy access to the Missouri River, with nice sandy banks that we attempted to make sand castles on, but ultimately couldn&rsquo;t get the moisture level correct.</p>

<p><img src="ezri_water.jpg" alt="ezri_water" /></p>

<p>The Yankton downtown is nice, but doesn&rsquo;t have as much going on as some of the other places we&rsquo;ve been. There&rsquo;s not a lot of foot traffic or the type of businesses you window shop at.</p>

<p>While in Yankton, we officially became South Dakotans! We got new licenses, but were surprised to find out that they don&rsquo;t have a DMV; licenses and registration are handled by 2 completely different departments. We should have registered our vehicles while in the Black Hills, so James had to make a flight from our current stop to take care of the truck and RV, while I&rsquo;ll make a flight later on to get the car switched over.</p>

<p><img src="james_plane.jpg" alt="james_plane" /></p>

<p>The reason we switched residency mostly comes down to the registration, in Nevada we were paying about 3x as much, and they required a Nevada smog check each year, that we can&rsquo;t get since we aren&rsquo;t near there. In South Dakota we&rsquo;ll be able to renew each year without worrying about smog.</p>

<h3 id="vermillion-sd">Vermillion, SD</h3>

<p><img src="castle.jpg" alt="castle" /></p>

<p>Vermillion is about a half hour from Yankton, so we also checked out the area there. Overall, we liked Vermillion a little better, there are a few more interesting things and it&rsquo;s a bit more progressive, probably due to the fact that it&rsquo;s a college town. They aren&rsquo;t allowed to mandate masks due to state rules, but they have a &lsquo;masks expected&rsquo; policy. We also saw several rainbow signs in business windows showing support for LGBTQ rights.</p>

<p><img src="rights.jpg" alt="rights" /></p>

<p>Vermillion&rsquo;s main street has the only breakfast place we could find that is open on Sunday (between both Vermillion and Yankton) and is very walkable with a few more browsable shops than Yankton had. They also have a gorgeous old church that looks like a castle.</p>

<p>Also on the main street we found a robotics club for kids that Ezri wanted to join immediately. She&rsquo;s a bit too young, but it&rsquo;s nice to see STEM related things like that.</p>

<p><img src="robotics.jpg" alt="robotics" /></p>

<p>I had a hard time finding any fabric stores in the area with anything besides quilting fabric, so we made the hour&rsquo;s drive to Hawarden, Iowa to a fabric outlet. It was interesting seeing this tiny town with hardly anything going on with such a large fabric store. I overheard other customers and it seems many drive hours to get there. I got some &lsquo;water damaged&rsquo; denim for 1.99 a yard and corduroy for 2.99 a yard that should keep me busy for a few weeks.</p>
