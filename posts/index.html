      Whew! Time really flies, been meaning to write another post for a while. We just left Joseph, Oregon after staying there about 3 months. With things mostly shut down, we decided it was best to hunker down in one place until things started opening back up again.
Joseph is just north of Wallowa Lake, and we made it to the north end of the lake a few times for Ezri to play in the water.

Our last few weeks in Fall City didn&rsquo;t go as we had planned, as we got a call in the middle of the night that James&rsquo;s step-mom, Kim, had passed away. Luckily James&rsquo;s work has paid bereavement leave and my work can be flexible, allowing us to fly out to Tennessee to support his dad.

      Hey friends, been meaning to write an update for a while, so many things have built up to update you on.
We&rsquo;re staying in an RV Resort near Fall City, a town of about 2,000 people. We are about 30 minutes from Issaquah, and 20 minutes from Andrew, Jason, and Ben (my brothers). This spot is more private than some of the others we&rsquo;ve stayed at, and we accidentally got a site that is right in the middle of where a lot of the employees are staying.

      Blue Valley RV Park we stayed at in Walla Walla had a great paved path that connected to the park, then went alongside a golf-course, some fields, and a few neighborhoods. With adding a few loops around a track that wasn&rsquo;t far off the path, I was able to run a full 10k. Unfortunately, I also discovered a recurring leg pain I thought I had rested away was not actually gone yet.

      The Boise Idaho area was beautiful, we visited at the perfect time to see the leaves changing color. On our drive we saw several fields of various crops, including hops, corn, alfalfa, apples, and pomegranates. While it got a little chilly at night, most days it was warm enough that we could bundle up and spend time outside.
We decided to stay at the Snake River Resort RV park outside of Boise in Homedale Idaho.

      Hi everyone, James here!
For our final week in Ely, we drove out to Great Basin National Park where we got to see Wheeler Peak, the second highest mountain in Nevada. This is a wonderful, out of the way park that we really should&rsquo;ve spent a few more days exploring. Wheeler Peak is 13,065 ft high, and you can drive to over 10,000 ft in your car - It really hits home just how high you are when you realize that if you were in an airliner, you could go to the bathroom at this height on a normal flight :-)

      We&rsquo;re getting close to the end of our stay in Ely, and it&rsquo;s been a really great time!
There&rsquo;s a train museum here, with a steam train and a diesel train you can buy tickets for. We rode the steam train, and Ezri had so much fun talking about the train and imitating the choo choo. The ride itself takes 90 minutes, with historical information peppered throughout. We were surprised to learn that in the early 1900s, Ely was the biggest town in Nevada, and had the tallest building (the Nevada Hotel, a whopping 6 stories high).

      After much thought, research, and planning, weâ€™re almost ready to hit the road! Our first target is Issaquah, Washington (near the Seattle area) where the client James is working with is located. Weâ€™re taking our time getting there, going up through Nevada, to a corner of Idaho, over into Oregon, and then into Washington. We donâ€™t have exact dates for all of the locations yet, but we have locked in our reservation in Ely, Nevada for October 1st through 12th.
