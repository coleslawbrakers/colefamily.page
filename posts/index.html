      Due to the lack of available spaces, we ended up staying in an RV Park in Woodland, PA, near Clearfield, and had to leave on Friday since the upcoming long weekend had the place fully booked for that night. The park has a good playground, a sandbox, a pond with a path circling it, and a few paths cut into the surrounding woods. We had many walks that I intended to be on those wooded paths, but that Ezri quickly insisted should instead become a walk to the playground.

      We moved to the Athens, Ohio area on May 1st, kicking off our 2021 season. Due to trouble finding RV parks with openings any closer, we stayed in Coolville, Ohio, about 30 minutes away. Our RV park had a playground with a litter of bunnies living under the merry-go-round, so we got to see some baby bunnies and even gave one of them a little pet. Ezri is so good at being gentle with little creatures.

      Southeast Michigan (Nov 14 - May 1) Hey friends! It&rsquo;s been a wee bit longer than I&rsquo;d thought since we last had an update. We had a great time in Milan, Michigan (close to Emily in Saline and near Ann Arbor). Ezri had an exciting joint birthday with her cousin Vera, complete with balloons. She now thinks anytime she has a balloon, we have to get one for Vera too.

      Champaign-Urbana, Illinois (Oct 30 - Nov 14) Champaign Illinois is a larger town of 88k people. It&rsquo;s home to the University of Illinois, so it has a lot of the same cultural, restaurant, and cycling amenities that come with it. We arrived the day before Halloween, and found a drive-thru trunk or treat the same night. After waiting in line for over an hour, we made it through and Ezri was very excited to get candy and talk to the people handing it out.

      DeForest (Madison Suburbs) DeForest is a suburb of about 9k people North of Madison, Wisconsin. We were eager to check out the Madison area as it is one of the few places in the US that has a car crash testing site, which is the type of work my sister, Emily does. If we decided to live in the area, there&rsquo;s a chance we could eventually convince her to join us.

      Knoxville, Iowa Knoxville is a pretty small town (about 7k people), and doesn&rsquo;t have a lot going on other than the sprint car raceway and museum they have. We stayed about a mile from a nice park, so Ezri had us walking to the playground frequently. If she had her way, we&rsquo;d do nothing else.
One thing we noticed about this area is that the towns all seem to have a central square with city hall, and their main street surrounds the square.

      Yankton spans across the state line, though most of the city is in South Dakota. The RV park we stayed in is right next to a 2 layer former rail/car bridge that is now strictly for pedestrians. We were about a mile from the downtown via the bridge, so we used it quite a bit. Underneath the bridge, they also have a few miles of rough trail that Ezri and I ran on.

      Bozeman, Montana We stayed in 2 separate RV parks in Bozeman, as we couldn&rsquo;t find a continuous reservation available.

There was a playground right near our site though, so Ezri really enjoyed going there each day.

      Kalispell, Montana Kalispell is definitely a contender for us, it has friendly people and beautiful landscapes. The weather proves to a be a little unpredictable: due to the mountains in the area, high winds whip through periodically and the weather can change rapidly. One day we went from blue sunny skies to high winds, rain, and hail within about 3 hours. Definitely makes for some excitement, but also some frustration; we got all dressed for a bike ride one morning only to have it start raining the second we got in the saddle.
